### Exploratory Data Analysis with Seaborn Using Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset - project-based from Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploratory-data-analysis-seaborn/home/welcome)

Employ the statistical data visualization library, Seaborn, to discover and explore the relationships in the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. 

Cover key concepts in exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations to identify and interpret inherent relationships in the data set, produce various chart types including histograms, violin plots, box plots, joint plots, pair grids, and heatmaps, customize plot aesthetics and apply faceting methods to visualize higher dimensional data. 

Thanks!
